We participated in a [UNICEF Symposium](https://www.unicef.ch/de/ueber-unicef/aktuell/veranstaltungen/2019-10-28/digitales-kind-analoge-gemeinde) in Zürich on child-friendly living spaces (kinderfreundlichen Lebensräumen), that focused on using new media in dialogue with children and young people, in the form of opportunities and challenges for municipal planning and development.

The risks of digital media for the child are well known, but the organizers wanted us to recognize digital technologies also as creative and meaningful tools of local politics and administration. This way, children as digital natives and adults of tomorrow could be more involved in planning and implementation processes.

We listened in to the morning presentations - some highlights below - and set up a stand similar to our pitch at [Swiss Digital Day](https://cividi.be/blog/en/2019-09-03) as part of the afternoon “Digital Market”, where we had a chance to encounter and get feedback from the participants. These were politically involved - young and old - from city halls, planning offices of several communes, professionals in spatial planning and development, architecture and traffic planning, social work, the academic and startup spheres.

Building on [previous events](https://cividi.be/blog/en/2019-09-03), the focus shifted from digital gadgets - printer challenges and data walk assignments - to conversations this time, giving us a chance to gather product-related inputs from experts and digital- or urbanism-savvy citizens. Next to us were the stands of [Crossiety](https://www.crossiety.ch/), [Engage.ch](https://www.engage.ch/), [Urban Equipe](https://www.urban-equipe.ch/), who we knew from the civic tech community, newcomers smalljobs, and visitors #stadtsache and Minecraft | Minetest. The hosts also ran their own stand explaining their children-friendly [cities certification](https://www.unicef.ch/de/unsere-arbeit/schweiz-liechtenstein/kinderfreundliche-gemeinde).

Our pitch: the pioneering project cividi, supported by the innovation partner Engagement Migros, provides digital tools for the analog city to make planning processes participative, evidence-based and smarter. On our data walks - which inspire visitors of all ages - urban spaces can be experienced physically and virtually, so that our participants develop a better spatial perception.

Thank you to Anja Bernet, Manuela Chablais, and the whole team at UNICEF Schweiz und Liechtenstein for their support. Looking forward to being part of more Youth Activities in the future!
